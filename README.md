## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.3, React 18, TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Google Genkit with Gemini 2.0 Flash model
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Development**: Turbopack for fast development builds

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeoHNDZ/Learn-code.git
   cd Learn-code
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (Required for AI features)
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
   # Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:9002`

## üîë AI Configuration

To enable all AI features, you need a Google Gemini API key:

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Generate an API key
3. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

Without this key, the repository analysis will work but AI features (explanations, summaries, suggestions) will show error messages.

## üéØ Getting Started

1. **Enter a Repository URL**: Paste any public GitHub repository URL in the input field
2. **Analyze Repository**: Click "Analyze Repository" to load the project structure
3. **Explore Files**: Use the sidebar file tree to navigate through the codebase
4. **Get AI Insights**:
   - Select code blocks and click "Explain Code" for detailed explanations
   - Click "File Summary" for AI-powered file analysis
   - Click "Suggestions" for improvement recommendations
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor your exploration progress in the progress bar
6. **Add Annotations**: Click "Annotations" to add collaborative notes to files
7. **Compare Files**: Use "Compare Files" to analyze differences between files
8. **Customize Experience**: Access Settings to personalize your interface
