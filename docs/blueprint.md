# **App Name**: StudioFlow

## Core Features:

- Codebase Navigator: Display a navigable file tree of the codebase.
- Code Viewer: Show the code with syntax highlighting in an editor pane.
- Code Explainer: Use generative AI to explain selected blocks of code in plain language, taking cues from the broader context of the code and its relations to other sections of the project.  The LLM may use a tool to summarize complex code elements and/or dependencies.
- Project Overview: Provide an overview of the project's architecture, key components, and data flow using AI. The LLM may use a tool to locate code segments which appear to be critical components.
- Repository Integration: Enable users to input the URL of a public GitHub repository (e.g. the one given https://github.com/LeoHNDZ/studio).
- Progress Tracking: Incorporate progress tracking with visual cues (similar to Duolingo) to show how much of the codebase the user has explored and understood.
- Puppertino Integration: Integrate the Puppertino CSS framework for a sleek, Apple-inspired design.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Subtle and clean light-blue (#579BB1) to evoke clarity and understanding, drawing inspiration from Apple's design language.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F4F7) to provide a clean and distraction-free coding environment, creating a sense of openness.
- Accent color: Muted yellow (#D4AC0D) for highlighting important elements, like Duolingo's rewards system.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headers and body text, giving a clean and modern aesthetic suitable for code-related content.
- Use minimalist, clear icons inspired by both Apple's clean interface and Duolingo's gamified visuals.
- Employ a split-screen layout with the file tree on the left and the code editor/explanation on the right, providing a structured, easy to understand layout.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations when navigating through the codebase and revealing explanations to give an engaging user experience.
